# SHONGKHEPON (সংেক্ষপণ) Summarization Highlighting Only Necessary Graphics from videos using K-means in Hybrid with Euclidean distance and PCA Optimizing Neural networks

 a video summary method that lets you shorten videos from an input video file, highlighting only the essential moments and removing repetitive scenes. In terms of key frame extraction, there can be different biases to determine which is essential. To solve that problem, we tried to use an unsupervised learning algorithm, K-means clustering.
